# Command-line Inventory Application Project: Groovify

A Module 2 project to develop and build a command-line inventory app, where employees keep track of inventory to utilize and access items using CRUD -- create, read, update and delete items. In this case, my music theme 'Groovify' provides songs and remixes as items.

## Getting Started
1. Cloned this repository.
1. Navigated to this cloned repository's directory in my command-line.
1. Node.js project created w/ 'package.json' file by running `npm init -y`.
1. Created an 'index.js' file.
1. Created a '.gitignore'.
1. Opened up this repository in VSCode.
1. Initialized by running `git commit -m` 'first commit for groovify'.
1. New branch created, and 'main' set up to track 'orgin/main' in terminal.

# Set-Up Instructions
Making sense for the 'groovify' app I've created, my data set has the following generated fields:
-Unique id
-String
-Boolean
-Number

For example, here's how you should use and understand the following:
- `id`: a unique id (for eg. 'PE').
- `songTitle`: "Fight The Power".
- `remixed`: a boolean for whether the song was remixed, or not.
- `numOfStreams`: the number of streams per song.

## Guide/Cheatsheet

- An employee should be able to create, add and update songs and remixes through the command-line.
- Automatically, the count on the number of streams per song can either increase, stay the same, but cannot decrease.

Sample Commands Available

At some point, all of the relevant files should connect so that any tests and all functions run appropriately.
